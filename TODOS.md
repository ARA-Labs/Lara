# TODOS

> M3 closed (GitHub issue #27, PR #28). Remaining items below are post-M3
> backlog; M4 (walking skeleton) scope is tracked separately.

## Performance

### Criterion-grade performance lab for the grounded evaluator

**What:** A proper benchmark suite (criterion) for the production grounded
evaluator with percentile reporting and regression curves.

**Why:** M3 ships a wall-clock smoke guard (absolute ceiling in CI, label
equality as the real assertion — plan-eng-review D10/D16). A real perf lab
becomes valuable when input sizes grow.

**Pros:** Regression curves instead of thresholds; catches gradual degradation
that a ceiling cannot.

**Cons:** New dependency and CI time; pointless at current corpus scale.

**Context:** Revisit when AF sizes exceed ~1k arguments or M4 incremental
checking lands. The M3 smoke guard (test-suite wall-clock assertion on the
ported #18 stress fixture plus a 100+ arg synthetic AF) is the interim guard.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** M3 production evaluator; trigger: AF sizes >1k or M4 scope

## Runtime (M4 candidates)

### Production-runtime concerns beyond the frozen core

**What:** Incremental re-checking (re-evaluate only affected claims when a
unit changes), large-graph performance, and diagnostic UX beyond located
rejections.

**Why:** M3 deliberately optimizes for conformance of the frozen symbolic
core; "production" eventually means more than a conformant batch checker
(outside-voice point, plan-eng-review 2026-07-26).

**Pros:** Captured before M4 planning; prevents M3's conformance focus from
becoming the permanent definition of done.

**Cons:** Explicitly out of M3 scope; some items may require spec evolution
(lara-core version bump governance).

**Context:** The frozen spec governs semantics, but incremental checking is a
runtime concern that does not touch semantics. Candidate M4 scope now that M3
closed issue #27.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** M3 closeout (#27)

## Completed

### Cache grounded adjacency for the M3 production evaluator (PR #28)

Production grounded evaluator (`Lara.Runtime`) computes adjacency once and is
byte-identical to the un-cached `Lara.Compile.checkedAF` path, differential-
tested against `Grounded.grounded` with a 120-argument ≤5 s perf guard.

### Full claim holes and incomplete-alternative diagnostics (PR #28)

`Lara.Reporting` computes `holes(P,p)` from the raw `Unit` boundary and emits
the `incompleteAlternative` diagnostics defined by spec §8 / §10.1.
